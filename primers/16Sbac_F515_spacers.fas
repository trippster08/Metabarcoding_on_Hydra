# This is the fasta file called in Cutadapt to search for multiple Forward 
# primers. Each primer sequence is preceded by an ^. This ^ indicates that the
# primer is anchored, which means it is found at the 5' end of the sequence,
#  and is required (i.e. the read will not be kept if the primer is not found).
